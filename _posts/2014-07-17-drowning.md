It seems like every other day there’s a new toolkit, API, language, library or SDK that I’d like to try out, play with and learn. D3, Angular.js, Leaflet.

Is it just me, or is the pace of these new developments and advances increasing? WebGL, three.js, OpenFL.

Maybe it’s a sign of the approaching singularity? Node.js, jQuery, Ajax.

Or maybe it’s not happening faster, but instead, maybe I’ve just been stuck in my little C++ world for too long while the bigger tech and web world advanced around me. Scala, D, Swift.

Hmm.. where to start. And what tech have I forgotten to mention?
