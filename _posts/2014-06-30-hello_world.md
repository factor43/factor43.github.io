Like many software developers, I’m always working on side projects. Or I’m thinking about the next potential side project. Most of them never see the light of day, either abandoned or somewhat “finished” and then forgotten. Sometimes I realize the initial idea wasn’t quite as cool as I thought it was. Or sometimes I’m only developing that project (be it tool, demo or algorithm) as a learning experience anyway, never intending it to be a finished product.

So I’m going to try something different. Instead of letting those side projects and tech experiments languish on a forgotten hard-drive never to be seen by anyone, I’m going to post them online instead. i.e. here at factor43.com. This will hopefully serve a couple of purposes – firstly, someone out there might find them interesting and secondly, it might help motivate me to get some of them a little bit closer to “finished”, or at least in a presentable state. Let’s see….
