title: AFL birthday bias

<p>Malcolm Gladwell describes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017930/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0316017930&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thenapbun-20&amp;linkId=NTQJPPMN5TKLYFWS"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Outliers: The Story of Success</span></a> how players born in the first few months of the year can have an advantage over those born in later months. The reason for this is&nbsp;that junior level competitions often have uniform cut-off&nbsp;dates (e.g. under 16 at January 1st), and being a few months older than other players can provide&nbsp;a big advantage. That is, being bigger, faster and stronger can lead to a positive feedback loop. &nbsp;A slightly older player is more likely to be chosen for representative teams, get better coaching, encouragement and opportunities etc. which is more likely to&nbsp;lead&nbsp;them to ultimately play at the highest level. This is an example of what is sometimes referred to as a “path dependent outcome”.</p>
<p>According to Gladwell, for various reasons this pattern is noticeable for some sports more than others, for instance hockey and baseball more so than (American) football and basketball. I wanted to quickly check if there was any birthday bias for Australian Rules AFL players, so I wrote a small python script to gather all 2014 AFL player birth dates and created the following chart showing the&nbsp;number of players born in each week of the year:</p>
